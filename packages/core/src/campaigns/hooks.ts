/**
 * Seams for the send tables (bodies by P3-T09). Every caller runs them INSIDE the transaction that changes the sequence.
 *
 * Rules for the hook bodies: only status SCHEDULED rows are touched (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED never waits, so
 * there is no lock-order constraint here). SENDING and UNCERTAIN rows belong to the sender / resolveUncertain.
 * A row skipped because a claim holds it is NOT cancelled by these hooks, so the CLAIM must protect itself:
 *
 * CLAIM-SIDE RE-CHECKS (T09, binding). Inside the claim transaction, after locking the ScheduledMessage row and then
 * the CampaignLead row (D21 order), verify ALL of the following, else CANCEL the row (uncertainAt NULL) and move on:
 *   - cl.state = 'ACTIVE' (QUEUED only for a step-1 row of the main sequence; PAUSED, STOPPED, COMPLETED reject);
 *   - sm.stepId = cl.currentStepId (a lead moved to a subsequence, or advanced, rejects every old-flow row);
 *   - Lead.deletedAt IS NULL (merged and deleted leads are never mailed);
 *   - the step is live (SequenceStep.deletedAt IS NULL);
 *   - the variant exists and is active.
 * A subsequence move leaves the lead with a new currentStepId and subsequenceId, so the second check rejects the
 * old rows even when the hook skipped them. Entering a subsequence on a QUEUED lead leaves accountId null: the planner
 * routes any row of a lead without a sticky sender through pickAccount (and re-routes it like step 1), and the first
 * SENT row makes its account sticky (planner.ts advanceLead). Re-entry vs the (campaignLeadId, stepId) key: entering
 * is refused once any step of that subsequence has a non-revivable row (subsequenceUsed); a plainly cancelled row is
 * revived in place by the planner's upsert. A delay change re-times the leads waiting on the step (recomputeDue)
 * from the previous step's sentAt, so a shortened delay makes a row immediately due (window and gap rules still apply).
 *
 * STALE TEXT (Revision 3): a claimed row keeps its rendered text and is sent as rendered. Any path that puts a row
 * BACK to SCHEDULED later (T11 RETRY / RELEASED / stale-claim recovery) and the claim itself must re-run
 * `renderForLead` under the row lock and overwrite renderedSubject / renderedBody / renderedText when the variant
 * text changed (deterministic per seed, no network). If the variant is gone or inactive, the row is CANCELLED.
 *
 * suppress() stamps SUPPRESSED on the CampaignLeads it stops. Callers that know better (T08 unsubscribe: UNSUBSCRIBED,
 * T11 bounce: BOUNCED) must set their own stopReason first or in the same transaction before calling suppress().
