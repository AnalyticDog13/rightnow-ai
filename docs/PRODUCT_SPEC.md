# RightNow.ai Product Specification (Instantly.ai feature parity)

Status: research draft, 2026-10-19. Sources are Instantly's public help center (help.instantly.ai), developer docs (developer.instantly.ai, API v2) and public pages. Nothing here is copied from Instantly beyond short phrases; no Instantly code, assets or branding are reused.

## 0. Introduction

**Goal.** An original, MIT-licensed, self-hosted cold-email platform that reproduces the publicly observable workflows of Instantly.ai: connect mailboxes, warm up/re-warm, build multi-step campaigns, send through reliable queues, manage leads, triage replies in a unified inbox, run a light CRM, report analytics, and automate via rules/webhooks.

**Tenancy.** One business owner at launch, but every row is scoped by `workspaceId` so multiple workspaces can be added later (Instantly itself is workspace-scoped: API keys, blocklists, quotas, analytics are per workspace; S22, S23).

**Honesty constraints (from the master spec; binding on every item below).**
1. No fabricated engagement. Warm-up traffic only between explicitly opted-in/authorized mailboxes, stored separately from customer metrics.
2. No claim that warm-up or any setting guarantees inbox placement; reactivation schedules are labeled "configurable plan".
3. "Provider accepted" is never reported as "delivered".
4. No spam-filter circumvention, no impersonation, no fake sender identities; respect real provider limits.
5. Anything Instantly does that depends on its private infrastructure (warm-up pool, AirMail/DFY mailboxes, SuperSearch database, shared reputation data) is listed in section 19 as not reproducible and is replaced by an honest alternative.
6. Live sending stays behind the Provider Compliance Gate (PS-DEPLOY-14).

**Item format.** `- [ ] PS-<AREA>-NN: requirement — Instantly behavior/defaults (source key)`. Source keys resolve in section 20. "(undocumented)" means Instantly's public docs do not state the behavior; RightNow picks a documented-in-DECISIONS.md default. `[optional]` appears only where the master prompt says optional.

Areas: UI, ACC, WARM, CAMP, SEQ, SEND, LEAD, INBOX, TRACK, CRM, ANALYTICS, AUTO, AI, SEC, REWARM, SYNC, DEPLOY.

## 1. Technical Architecture (master §1)

- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-01: Monorepo with separate packages for web frontend, API, provider integrations, campaign scheduler, sending workers, inbox sync, analytics, CRM — Instantly is a single hosted SaaS; internal structure not public (undocumented).
- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-02: Default stack Next.js/React/TS/Tailwind/shadcn-ui, Node backend, PostgreSQL+Prisma, Redis+BullMQ, Auth.js, Recharts, Docker Compose, Vitest+Playwright — master-spec choice, no Instantly counterpart.
- [ ] PS-SEC-01: Every table carries `workspaceId`; all queries filtered by it; single-owner UI at launch but workspace switcher data model present — Instantly: workspaces own accounts, leads, campaigns, API keys, blocklists; accounts can be moved between workspaces; workspace members have roles (S23 Workspace, Workspace Member, "Move accounts between workspaces").
- [ ] PS-SEC-02: Workspace-scoped API keys with scoped permissions (`resource:action`, e.g. `accounts:create`, `leads:read`, `all:all`) — Instantly API v2 uses bearer keys with scopes of that form (S4, S5, S10).
- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-03: Repo ships MIT LICENSE, setup docs, Prisma migrations, Dockerfile/compose, `.env.example`, tests, deployment instructions — master §1.
- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-04: REST API v1 prefix `/api/v1`, JSON, bearer auth, 429 on rate-limit, 402-equivalent not needed (no billing) — Instantly API v2: base `/api/v2`, bearer, limits 100 req/s and 6,000 req/min per workspace shared across keys, 429 on excess (S22).
- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-05: API error contract: 400 invalid body (reject unknown properties), 401 bad/revoked key, 404, 429 — Instantly schemas set additionalProperties false on create bodies (S3, S4, S5).
- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-06: OpenAPI document published for the RightNow API — Instantly publishes OpenAPI (api_v2.json) (S23).

---

## 2. Product Interface (master §2)

- [ ] PS-UI-01: Left navigation with exactly: Dashboard, Email Accounts, Warm-Up & Deliverability, Campaigns, Leads, Unified Inbox, CRM, Analytics, Automations, Settings — master §2; Instantly's own nav groups Campaigns, Accounts, Unibox, CRM, Analytics, Lead Finder/SuperSearch (no SuperSearch clone) (S15).
- [ ] PS-UI-02: Responsive layouts, searchable/sortable/paginated tables, saved filters, bulk-select action bar — Instantly list views support filter+search and bulk action bars (S14).
- [ ] PS-UI-03: Every control wired to real backend behavior; no dead buttons; Playwright smoke test walks each nav item — master §2.
- [ ] PS-UI-04: Dashboard widgets: sends today vs capacity, active campaigns progress, reply/positive/bounce rates, account health strip, remaining daily capacity, pending reminders/tasks — master §11 + Instantly workspace analytics (S16).
- [ ] PS-UI-05: Original visual design, light/dark theme, accessible components (keyboard, labels, contrast) — master §2.
- [ ] PS-UI-06: Global status badges for accounts and campaigns using the status sets in PS-ACC-14 and PS-CAMP-20 — Instantly numeric status enums (S4, S9).
- [ ] PS-UI-07: Global date-range and workspace-timezone display; analytics bucketed in UTC unless user chooses otherwise — Instantly reports in UTC (S16).
- [ ] PS-UI-08: Tags (custom tags) assignable to accounts and campaigns, filterable everywhere — Instantly custom tags map to accounts/campaigns; `email_tag_list` on campaign limits sending accounts (S3, S23 Custom Tag).

---

## 3. Connected Email Accounts (master §3)

### 3.1 Connection flows
- [ ] PS-ACC-01: "Connect with Google" OAuth 2.0 (authorization code, offline access) and Gmail API send/read — Instantly offers Google and Microsoft OAuth init endpoints returning an auth URL (S8).
- [ ] PS-ACC-02: OAuth session object: `sessionId`, `authUrl`, 10-minute expiry; client polls status every ~5 s: `pending|success|error|expired`; result consumed on first read; error codes include `account_exists`, `server_error`, `expired` — Instantly OAuth connection flow (S8).
- [ ] PS-ACC-03: Microsoft 365/Outlook via Microsoft OAuth + Graph (send, delta read) — Instantly provider code 3 (S4, S8).
- [ ] PS-ACC-04: Custom IMAP/SMTP connection: email, first/last name, IMAP host/port/username/password, SMTP host/port/username/password, test-connection before save — Instantly provider code 1 requires all twelve fields (S4).
- [ ] PS-ACC-05: Provider enum in RightNow: custom_imap, google, microsoft (AWS/AirMail/DFY from Instantly are out of scope, see section 19) — Instantly codes 1,2,3,4,8,11 (S4).
- [ ] PS-ACC-06: Google Workspace and free Gmail both supported; document Google Cloud Console project setup, OAuth consent screen, least-privilege scopes, and verification steps — master §3.
- [ ] PS-ACC-07: Refresh tokens and IMAP/SMTP passwords stored encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM, key from secret store); never returned by the API — Instantly responses omit IMAP/SMTP credentials (S4).
- [ ] PS-ACC-08: Reconnect flow keeps account id, settings, history, campaign assignments (no delete+reconnect) — Instantly docs tell users to delete and reconnect after token errors (S18); RightNow deliberately does better (master reactivation §2).
- [ ] PS-ACC-09: Revocation: user can disconnect (revoke token at provider, stop jobs, keep history) — master §3.
- [ ] PS-ACC-10: Multiple independent mailboxes per workspace; duplicate email blocked with `account_exists` — S8.
- [ ] PS-ACC-11: Bulk account management: multi-select pause/resume, set daily limit, set sending gap, set signature, apply tags, enable/disable warm-up, delete — Instantly exposes pause-multiple and enable/disable warm-up for many accounts (S23 Account).

### 3.2 Per-account settings
- [ ] PS-ACC-12: Per-account `dailyLimit` (campaign emails/day) — Instantly guidance 30 campaign emails/account/day, 10 warm-up/day; plain-number field, nullable (S25, S4, S18).
- [ ] PS-ACC-13: Per-account `sendingGap` in minutes, integer 0–1440 — Instantly `sending_gap` range 0–1440 (S4). Campaign-level min gap default 9 min + random 5 min is separate (PS-CAMP-12).
- [ ] PS-ACC-14: Account status enum: Active, Paused, Temporarily paused (auto-resumes), Connection Error, Soft Bounce Error, Sending Error; plus RightNow adds Re-Warming, Inactive, Needs Attention as derived display states — Instantly status 1,2,3,-1,-2,-3 (S4).
- [ ] PS-ACC-15: Status message object with provider code, command, response, message for diagnostics (shown in UI) — Instantly `status_message` {code, command, response, e_message, responseCode} (S4).
- [ ] PS-ACC-16: "Enable slow ramp" per-account toggle: new accounts start low and gain a fixed amount per day until the daily limit — Instantly: starts at 2 emails and adds 2/day (S25); an Instantly blog says warm-up +1/day and campaign slow ramp +2/day, sources disagree (S24). Use +2/day default, configurable.
- [ ] PS-ACC-17: Signature (rich text/HTML) per account, appended to sends — Instantly `signature` field (S4).
- [ ] PS-ACC-18: `replyTo` address per account — Instantly `reply_to` (S4).

- [ ] PS-ACC-21: Tags per account; campaigns may restrict sending to accounts with given tags — S3 `email_tag_list`.
- [ ] PS-ACC-22: Account-to-campaign mapping view: given an account, list campaigns using it — Instantly "Get campaigns associated with an email" (S23).
- [ ] PS-ACC-23: Per-account daily activity and remaining limit shown in the accounts table (sent today / limit / remaining) — master §3; Instantly has daily account analytics (S23).
- [ ] PS-ACC-24: "Test account vitals" / connectivity diagnostics: IMAP login, SMTP auth, token validity, MX/SPF/DKIM/DMARC presence, custom-domain CNAME — Instantly "Test domain setup" checks MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC (S18, S23).
- [ ] PS-ACC-25: "Mark as fixed" action clears an error status after the user remediates and a re-test passes — Instantly has "Mark an account as fixed" endpoint (S23).
- [ ] PS-ACC-26: Autofix state for transient errors (in progress / failed / succeeded) — Instantly `autofix_failed` tri-state (S4).
- [ ] PS-ACC-27: Pause/resume single and multiple accounts; paused accounts excluded from rotation immediately, queued jobs rescheduled — S23.
- [ ] PS-ACC-28: Delete account preserves historical emails/events for analytics (soft delete) — undocumented in Instantly; RightNow decision.
- [ ] PS-ACC-29: Microsoft SMTP-disabled remediation hint shown on connection error — Instantly help: enable SMTP, remove account, wait ~1 hour, reconnect (S18).

- [ ] PS-CAMP-02: Campaign export/import as JSON (sequence + settings, no leads) — Instantly export-to-JSON and create-from-shared (S23).
- [ ] PS-CAMP-03: Draft campaigns cannot send; subsequences tab appears only after first launch — Instantly (S13).
- [ ] PS-CAMP-04: Campaign statuses: Draft, Active, Paused, Completed, Running Subsequences, Accounts Unhealthy, Bounce Protect, Account Suspended — Instantly codes 0,1,2,3,4,-1,-2,-99 (S9).

- [ ] PS-CAMP-06: Campaign wizard sections: Leads, Sequences, Schedule, Options (with Sending accounts) — Instantly campaign builder tabs (S1; layout partly undocumented).
- [ ] PS-CAMP-07: Assign multiple sending accounts; system rotates among them; no account-count limit — Instantly "Accounts to use" (S1).
- [ ] PS-CAMP-08: Campaign can reference lead lists or direct uploads; leads attach to campaign (S5 `campaign`, `list_id`).
- [ ] PS-CAMP-09: Per-campaign `owner` (workspace user) for filtering and CRM reporting; custom tags on campaigns — Instantly Owner and Custom Tags (S1, S3 `owned_by`).
- [ ] PS-CAMP-10: Positive-lead value `plValue` per campaign (value of each positive lead) feeding pipeline value reports — S3 `pl_value`.

### 4.2 Schedule
- [ ] PS-CAMP-11: One or more named schedules per campaign, each with: days of week (seven booleans), from/to time (24h HH:MM), IANA timezone (required); campaign-level optional start_date and end_date (YYYY-MM-DD in campaign timezone) — Instantly `campaign_schedule.schedules[]` min 1, `timing.from/to`, `days` keys "0"–"6" (mapping to weekdays not defined in the docs; RightNow uses 0=Sunday), timezone enum of ~100 zones (S3).
- [ ] PS-CAMP-12: Schedule presets: any day/any time, office hours, custom — Instantly options (S1).
- [ ] PS-CAMP-13: Min time gap between emails default 9 minutes; random additional time default 5 minutes (so 9–14 min between sends per account); warn below 5 minutes — Instantly (S1, S25); API `email_gap` and `random_wait_max` in minutes (S3).
- [ ] PS-CAMP-14: Lead local-time sending ("send in recipient timezone") — undocumented as a campaign option; optional extension, not parity.

### 4.3 Options
- [ ] PS-CAMP-15: Daily limit = cap on total campaign emails per day across all assigned accounts; recommend 30 x accounts — Instantly (S1, S25). Effective cap per account = min(account limit, share of campaign limit, warm-up/reactivation allowance).

- [ ] PS-CAMP-20: Stop on auto-reply (OOO etc.): off by default recommended when using out-of-office smart pause (resume date); when on, auto-reply stops the lead — S1, S3 `stop_on_auto_reply`.
- [ ] PS-CAMP-21: Open tracking toggle and link tracking toggle per campaign; global org-level overrides (disable open tracking / always text-only first email) win over campaign settings — S1, S17.
- [ ] PS-CAMP-22: Delivery optimization: send as text-only (all steps) and send first email as text-only; enabling text-only disables open tracking and strips images/HTML styling — S1, S3 `text_only`, `first_email_text_only`, S17.
- [ ] PS-CAMP-23: Provider matching (`matchLeadEsp`): prefer sender with same ESP as recipient (Gmail to Gmail, Outlook to Outlook); needs at least one matching account — S1, S3. ESP detection for lead stored in lead record (Google, Microsoft, Zoho, Yahoo, Yandex, Other) — S5 ESP codes.
- [ ] PS-CAMP-24: ESP routing rules: list of {action send|do_not_send, recipientEsp[all|google|outlook|other], senderEsp[all|google|outlook|other]} evaluated at account selection — S3 `provider_routing_rules`.
- [ ] PS-CAMP-25: Insert unsubscribe header (List-Unsubscribe + one-click) toggle; RightNow default ON for compliance — S1 `insert_unsubscribe_header` (default undocumented).
- [ ] PS-CAMP-26: Allow risky emails (leads whose verification is Risky/Catch-all) toggle, default off; Disable BounceProtect toggle with warning — S1, S3.
- [ ] PS-CAMP-27: BounceProtect: automatically pause campaign (status Bounce Protect) when bounce rate threshold exceeded; RightNow default: pause when hard-bounce rate > 3% over >= 50 sends in rolling 24h (configurable) — Instantly feature exists, threshold undocumented in fetched pages (S21 refers to a "High Bounce Auto-Pause" article).
- [ ] PS-CAMP-28: Limit emails per company (domain): caps daily emails to leads sharing a domain; scope per campaign or workspace; mode custom/disabled; min 1 — S1, S3 `limit_emails_per_company_override`.
- [ ] PS-CAMP-29: CC and BCC recipient lists on every campaign email (CC visible, BCC hidden) — S1, S3.
- [ ] PS-CAMP-30: Auto-optimize A/Z test: pick winning metric (reply rate, click rate, open rate); disable underperforming variants automatically; thresholds undocumented, RightNow requires min sample (default 100 sends per variant) before disabling — S1, S3 `auto_variant_select.trigger`, S20.
- [ ] PS-CAMP-31: Reset A/Z variant usage tracking daily (preference) — default balances variant usage over campaign lifetime — S20.
- [ ] PS-CAMP-32: Preview personalized message per lead before launch (render with real lead data, spintax resolved, fallback shown) and send-test-email action — master §4; Instantly send-a-test-email (S23, S12).
- [ ] PS-CAMP-33: Pre-launch validation: no sending accounts, no leads, missing subject/body, unresolved variable, invalid schedule, unverified tracking domain, compliance gate disabled provider — master §4.
- [ ] PS-CAMP-34: Campaign sending status endpoint/UI explains why a campaign is not sending (outside window, quota reached, accounts unhealthy, no eligible leads, startup sync pending) — Instantly "Get campaign sending status" (S23).
- [ ] PS-CAMP-35: Campaign-level lead statuses: Active, Paused, Completed, Bounced, Unsubscribed, Skipped — S5.
- [ ] PS-CAMP-36: Conflict prevention: a contact already in an active campaign is not added to another unless the user disables dedupe; global rule prevents two active sequences on the same email — master §7; Instantly workspace-wide duplicate check on import (S19).

---

## 5. Sequences, Personalization, A/B, Spintax (master §4)

- [ ] PS-SEQ-01: Unlimited ordered steps per sequence; step type `email` only at launch — Instantly step type enum has only `email` (S3).
- [ ] PS-SEQ-02: Step delay = number + unit (minutes|hours|days; default unit days); max total delay 366 days; step 1 delay 0 — S3.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-03: Delay counted from previous step's actual send time and only fires inside a schedule window — S1/S3 (exact semantics undocumented).
- [ ] PS-SEQ-04: Each step has >= 1 variant (A/Z), each with subject and HTML body; up to 26 variants per step; variants can be disabled individually — S3 `v_disabled`, S20 (26 max).
- [ ] PS-SEQ-05: Variant assignment is balanced over campaign lifetime by default (new variants catch up); optional daily reset; assignment recorded per send — S20.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-06: Follow-up steps may reuse previous subject (empty subject = reply in same thread) — undocumented in fetched pages; RightNow: empty subject on step N>1 sends as threaded reply (In-Reply-To/References).

- [ ] PS-SEQ-08: Out-of-office handling: detect auto-reply, optionally pause the lead and resume sending after the OOO return date ("AI Smart Pause"/OOO Resume); resume date visible in lead details — S1, S14.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-09: Subsequences: separate mini-sequences attached to a campaign, triggered by (a) lead status/label (default or custom, multiple allowed), (b) activity: email opened, link clicked, campaign completed without reply, (c) reply keywords (semicolon-separated exact phrases) — S13.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-10: Subsequence settings: pre-delay before step 1 (minutes/hours/days), inherits campaign schedule and daily limit by default (custom or "no limit"), optional ignore-account-limits (with warning; RightNow disallows it for warming/re-warming accounts), pause/resume, duplicate, analytics — S13, S3 `pre_delay`.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-11: Only leads labeled after the subsequence is active enter automatically; existing leads can be moved manually; lead has `subsequenceId`; a lead can be removed from a subsequence; sends occur within ~10 minutes of entry if schedule/limits allow — S13, S5, S23.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-12: Variables (camelCase, case-sensitive, matching CSV headers): `{{firstName}} {{lastName}} {{companyName}} {{jobTitle}} {{website}} {{phone}} {{personalization}} {{email}}`, custom lead fields by column name, sender variables `{{sendingAccountFirstName}} {{sendingAccountLastName}} {{sendingAccountEmail}}` (RightNow naming; sender variable names are inferred, the fetched Instantly pages did not list them) — S5 payload known keys, S12.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-13: `{{industry}}` and other master-listed fields exist as standard lead columns — master §4.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-14: Fallback syntax `{{var | fallback}}`; fallbacks can chain (`{{firstName | lastName | for you}}` style) inside spintax options — S12.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-15: Spintax `{{RANDOM | a | b | c}}` picks one option per lead, deterministic per (lead, step, variant) so retries do not reshuffle; variables allowed inside options; usable in subject and body — S12.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-16: Conditional blocks `{% if var == "value" %}...{% endif %}` (LiquidJS subset), case-sensitive compare; hidden-variable trick not needed since RightNow resolves variables from lead payload directly — S12.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-17: `{{personalization}}` is a free-text lead field (typically AI-written opener) inserted verbatim — S5.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-18: Template validation: unknown variable, unmatched braces, missing `RANDOM` keyword, empty fallback, variable absent from >0 leads (warn count) — S12 troubleshooting; master §4 validation.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-19: Unsubscribe link/variable `{{unsubscribeLink}}` available in body and auto-appended footer if absent when compliance setting on — master §14 (Instantly variable name undocumented).
- [ ] PS-SEQ-20: Body stored as HTML with plain-text alternative auto-generated; `<br/>` line breaks — S3.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-21: Per-step and per-variant analytics: sent, opened, replied, clicked, reply rate, positive reply rate, opportunities, meetings booked, won; date-range selectable — S20, S23 steps analytics.
- [ ] PS-SEQ-22: Reply-dependent branching only via subsequences (no full visual flow builder) — S13.

- [ ] PS-SEND-05: Atomic quota reservation (Redis Lua or Postgres row lock) before enqueue; released on definite failure; counted on provider acceptance; day boundary in campaign/account timezone — master §5.
- [ ] PS-SEND-06: Workspace-wide daily quota in addition to per-account/per-campaign — master §5.
- [ ] PS-SEND-07: Idempotency key per (leadId, campaignId, step, variant); unique DB constraint; "uncertain" state when a send outcome is unknown after crash; uncertain sends are reconciled against the sent folder before any retry, never blindly resent — master §5, Local-First.
- [ ] PS-SEND-08: Worker crash recovery: stalled-job detection, lease expiry, reconciliation of in-flight sends — master §5.
- [ ] PS-SEND-09: Provider rate-limit handling: honor 429/`Retry-After`, Gmail/Graph throttling errors, SMTP 4xx; exponential backoff with jitter and max attempts, then mark failed — master §5.
- [ ] PS-SEND-10: Message states: scheduled, reserved, sending, provider_accepted, failed, bounced_hard, bounced_soft, delivered_unknown (never "delivered" unless a provider receipt/DSN says so) — master §5.

## 7. Warm-Up and Deliverability (master §6)

- [ ] PS-WARM-01: Per-account warm-up enable/disable; bulk toggle — S23 enable/disable warm-up for accounts.
- [ ] PS-WARM-02: Setting "daily warm-up limit" (max warm-up emails/day), suggested 10 for new accounts, separate from campaign daily limit — S2, S25.
- [ ] PS-WARM-03: Setting "increase per day" (ramp): API enum disabled|0|1|2|3|4; UI default 1 (day 1 sends 1, +1 daily until limit) — S2, S4.
- [ ] PS-WARM-04: Setting "reply rate %" suggested 30 for new accounts: share of warm-up messages that receive a reply (only meaningful between opted-in participants) — S2.
- [ ] PS-WARM-05: "Disable slow warm-up" skips the ramp; for already-warmed accounts only, warn otherwise — S2.
- [ ] PS-WARM-06: Weekdays-only mode: do not send warm-up on weekends (still receive) — S2.
- [ ] PS-WARM-07: Warm-up filter tag: a label (customizable, "generate random") applied to warm-up messages so they can be auto-filed out of the primary inbox and excluded from inbox sync/analytics; change applies next cycle — S2.
- [ ] PS-WARM-08: Advanced warm-up knobs exist in Instantly: read emulation (headless browser "reading"), open rate %, spam-protection % (rescue from spam), mark-important %, warm custom tracking domain — S2, S4. RightNow honesty rule: only implement what is real between opted-in mailboxes (opening/marking read/rescuing from spam on mailboxes the user owns); do not simulate human behavior to fool filters; document each knob as "cooperative-mailbox action" or "not provided".
- [ ] PS-WARM-09: Warm-up traffic is plain text, separate message type, stored in a separate table, excluded from customer analytics, replies, unibox, CRM — S2 (plain text), master §6.
- [ ] PS-WARM-10: Warm-up status enum: Paused, Active, Banned, Spam Folder Unknown, Permanent Suspension — Instantly 0,1,-1,-2,-3 (S4). RightNow maps to: Paused, Active, Provider-blocked, Placement-unknown, Suspended.
- [ ] PS-WARM-11: Warm-up health/score per account (0–100) — Instantly exposes `stat_warmup_score` (S4); formula undocumented. RightNow formula documented in-app: weighted from hard/soft bounce rate, provider errors, auth DNS status, warm-up reply/receive success between participants, and (if run) inbox-placement tests. Labeled an internal indicator, not a reputation guarantee.
- [ ] PS-WARM-12: Warm-up analytics per account per day: sent, received, replied, landed-in-spam (where measurable between cooperative mailboxes), health score trend — S23 warmup analytics.

## 16. Existing Mailbox Reactivation and Re-Warm-Up (master addendum)

Instantly has no dedicated reactivation product: users lower limits manually, rely on warm-up, or delete and reconnect on token errors (S18). Items below are required by the master spec, with Instantly warm-up knobs as inspiration.

- [ ] PS-REWARM-01: Per account track: last outbound email date, last campaign activity date, historical sending volume, historical bounce and reply rates, recent provider errors, inactivity duration, previous warm-up config, current SPF/DKIM/DMARC health.
- [ ] PS-REWARM-02: Configurable inactivity thresholds (presets 7, 14, 30, 60 days); accounts beyond threshold flagged "Inactive / may benefit from gradual restart".
- [ ] PS-REWARM-03: "Re-Warm Account" button on Email Accounts; keeps account id, settings, history; no delete/reconnect required.
- [ ] PS-REWARM-04: On start: recheck connectivity (token refresh, IMAP/SMTP), SPF, DKIM, DMARC; block start with explicit reasons if failing (token expired triggers reconnect flow that preserves the account record).
- [ ] PS-REWARM-05: Reset campaign sending allowance to a conservative start (default 5/day, configurable) and ramp by a configurable curve (default +2/day, consistent with slow-ramp +2/day in S25) up to the pre-inactivity target.
- [ ] PS-REWARM-06: Scheduler reads the allowance from a single source of truth (DB row + Redis counter) so all workers and all campaigns respect it simultaneously.
- [ ] PS-REWARM-07: Health gates: pause or reduce allowance (and hold a ramp step) when bounce rate, provider errors, or DNS health cross thresholds; resume stepwise after recovery window.
- [ ] PS-REWARM-08: Exit criteria configurable (e.g. allowance reached target AND N consecutive days with bounce < threshold AND no provider errors); then status returns to Active with normal limits.
- [ ] PS-REWARM-09: Automatic reactivation protection (setting): before the next campaign send, an account over the threshold gets recommended or auto-applied reduced-volume restart; user chooses recommend vs auto per workspace.
- [ ] PS-REWARM-10: Dashboard: status (Active, Inactive, Re-Warming, Paused, Needs Attention), days since last send, current allowance, target volume, progress bar, historical and current deliverability indicators, warnings, estimated schedule labeled "configurable plan, not a guaranteed reputation recovery timeline".
- [ ] PS-REWARM-11: Optional warm-up activity only with opted-in participants or external provider; otherwise the volume-ramp workflow is the whole feature (honest mode) — S2 pool is not reproducible.
- [ ] PS-REWARM-12: Runs through persistent BullMQ repeatable jobs; works while the user is offline (on a running server) and catches up after downtime without burst-sending.
- [ ] PS-REWARM-13: Tests: inactive 30 days, inactive 60 days, reconnect after OAuth token expiry, bounce-rate breach during re-warm, successful return to normal limits.
- [ ] PS-REWARM-14: Independent verification that a previously active account is reactivated without losing settings or history (data-preservation test).

## 17. Offline Recovery and Inbox Synchronization (master §3 inbox sync + addendum)

- [ ] PS-SYNC-01: Provider sync strategies: Gmail `history.list` + Pub/Sub watch (fallback polling), Microsoft Graph delta queries + change notifications (fallback polling), IMAP IDLE with UID/UIDVALIDITY tracking (fallback polling interval default 2–5 min) — master §3.
- [ ] PS-SYNC-02: Persist per-account checkpoint (Gmail historyId, Graph deltaLink, IMAP UIDVALIDITY+last UID) and sync run log.
- [ ] PS-SYNC-03: Incremental sync by default; when checkpoint expired/invalid (Gmail history too old, Graph delta token expired, UIDVALIDITY change) fall back to full reconciliation of a bounded window (default window = max(30 days, downtime + margin)).
- [ ] PS-SYNC-04: Import both incoming and provider-sent messages (including mail sent outside RightNow) and match to campaign sends by Message-ID/headers to avoid duplicate records.
- [ ] PS-SYNC-05: Dedupe by provider message id + RFC Message-ID; threading by headers; idempotent upserts.
- [ ] PS-SYNC-06: Detect and apply while offline: replies, auto-replies, bounces (DSN), unsubscribes (incl. List-Unsubscribe mailto), manual deletions, state changes; update campaign/lead status, CRM, analytics.
- [ ] PS-SYNC-07: Startup gate: on every process start, sending is blocked (global "sync-pending" flag per account and global) until reconciliation completes "sufficiently" (all accounts reached current checkpoint or are marked failed/excluded); UI shows progress.
- [ ] PS-SYNC-08: After sync, recompute stale follow-ups: cancel steps for any lead with a reply/unsub/bounce discovered; reschedule remaining sends into the next valid windows.
- [ ] PS-SYNC-09: Never burst-send an offline backlog: overdue sends are re-planned under normal gaps, daily quotas, schedule windows, and re-warm allowances.
- [ ] PS-SYNC-10: Uncertain sends (job in `sending` at crash time) reconciled against the provider Sent folder before retrying; unresolved ones held for review, never auto-resent.
- [ ] PS-SYNC-11: Mandatory automated tests simulating 1, 7, and 30 days of downtime, including expired history ids, replies/bounces during downtime, and verification of zero duplicate sends and zero missed follow-up cancellations.
- [ ] PS-SYNC-12: Document events not reconstructable offline: tracking-pixel opens and link clicks that occur while no tracking endpoint is reachable, real-time webhook events, ephemeral provider notifications — see section 19.
- [ ] PS-SYNC-13: Sync health shown per account (last success, lag, errors) and surfaced in account status — master §3.

## 18. Local-First and VPS-Ready Deployment

- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-07: One codebase, two modes; mode selected by env profile (`MODE=local|vps`).
- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-08: Local: Docker Compose runs web, workers, scheduler, Postgres, Redis; named volumes; Redis AOF persistence; start/stop commands; no work while machine asleep, correct recovery afterwards (SYNC).
- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-09: VPS: same compose with health checks, restart policies (`unless-stopped`), durable volumes, HTTPS via reverse proxy (Caddy or Traefik with automatic certs), secrets via env files/Docker secrets, ops runbook.
- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-10: Scripts for both modes: start, stop, upgrade (migrate then restart), backup (pg_dump + Redis snapshot + encryption-key note), restore; tested.
- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-11: Tested local-to-VPS migration procedure (dump, transfer, restore, verify checkpoints, rotate OAuth redirect URIs, DNS/tracking-domain switch, first-start sync gate).
- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-12: Health endpoints `/healthz` (liveness) and `/readyz` (db, redis, queue, sync gate status).
- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-13: Tracking endpoint must be publicly reachable to record opens/clicks; local mode documents tunnel/limitations.
- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-14: Provider Compliance Gate: before enabling live sending, document each provider's current API acceptable-use rules; do not assume a Gmail OAuth app may send unsolicited commercial mail; unsupported channels sit behind a disabled integration interface; campaign creation and tests (dry-run / local SMTP sink) work without live provider access.
- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-15: Dry-run/sandbox send mode that exercises the full pipeline against a fake SMTP/Graph/Gmail adapter for tests and demos.
- [ ] PS-DEPLOY-16: CI runs Vitest unit/integration and Playwright e2e on Docker services.

## 19. Known limitations / not reproducible

1. **Instantly's warm-up pool.** Instantly warm-up exchanges mail with other participating mailboxes; the pool, its sizing, selection and reply behavior are private (S2). RightNow cannot reproduce it. Replacement: gradual volume ramp, optional opted-in peer mailboxes owned by the same user, and optional external providers via an interface. No warm-up can guarantee inbox placement.
2. **Fake-human signals.** Read emulation via headless browsers, forced "mark important", automatic spam rescue at configurable percentages exist in Instantly (S2). RightNow only performs these on mailboxes the user owns and has opted in, and labels them as test traffic; it does not inflate customer engagement metrics.
3. **Warm-up health score formula** is undocumented (S4 exposes only `stat_warmup_score`). RightNow's score is its own transparent formula and not comparable to Instantly's.
4. **AirMail, DFY mailboxes, pre-warmed domains, domain purchase/forwarding** (S23) depend on Instantly infrastructure. Out of scope.
5. **SuperSearch / Lead Finder / AI enrichment / company lists / website visitors** use Instantly's data. Out of scope; only hook interfaces for external enrichment and verification.
6. **Built-in email verification** (0.25 credit/lead, S27) depends on Instantly's verifier. RightNow ships syntax/MX/disposable checks plus a provider hook.
7. **AI Sales Agent, AI Inbox Manager, AI Deliverability Agent** (S23) are autonomous agents. Only optional, human-reviewed AI is in scope.
8. **Tracking-pixel opens and clicks during downtime** are lost: opens/clicks that occur while the tracking domain or server is offline cannot be reconstructed. Replies, bounces, unsubscribes, sent mail are reconstructible from provider mailboxes.
9. **Open tracking is inherently an estimate.** Apple MPP, security scanners and image proxies create false opens; text-only mail cannot register opens. Reply and click-with-human-timing are stronger signals. Instantly's public pages do not describe bot filtering (S17).
10. **Delivered vs accepted.** Providers rarely give delivery receipts; RightNow reports provider-accepted and bounce/DSN outcomes only.
11. **Gmail/Microsoft acceptable use.** Sending unsolicited bulk mail through OAuth-based API apps may be disallowed or require verification; live sending stays gated (PS-DEPLOY-14). Real provider limits override configured limits.
12. **Undocumented Instantly behaviors with RightNow-chosen defaults:** BounceProtect threshold, auto-optimize A/Z sample thresholds, webhook retry/disable policy, weekday key mapping in `days`, whether follow-up delay counts from schedule-adjusted time, default for unsubscribe header and tracking toggles, health-score weights, sender variable names, Instantly CRM stage/value field details (help article "Managing Opportunities" not retrieved).
13. **Source disagreements:** warm-up increment default (1/day in help center, "+2/day slow ramp" for campaigns, example "2,4,6" in blog) (S2, S24, S25); reply-rate definition differs between campaign and account analytics (S16).
14. **Plan-gated features in Instantly** (Hyper Growth/Light Speed: advanced warm-up, prioritize new leads, subsequences, per-company limits, Unibox replying) are all available to RightNow users with no gating.
15. **Local mode** cannot run background work while the computer is off; reactivation, follow-ups and sync resume only after startup reconciliation.
16. Instantly's SDK/CLI/MCP, billing/plan endpoints and agency white-label domain features are not reproduced.
